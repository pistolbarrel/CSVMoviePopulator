From the story of a nobleman struck blind after marrying a much younger and promiscuous bride to a climactic trip to a hell populated by friars and demons (surely one of the most outrageously conceived and realized sequences ever committed to film), this is an endlessly imaginative work of merry blasphemy, framed by Pasolini’s portrayal of Chaucer himself.","Pier Paolo Pasolini","Criterion","1:51:33","Hugh Griffith; Laura Betti; Ninetto Davoli"
"Cat People (1942)","1942","The first of the horror films producer Val Lewton made for RKO Pictures redefined the genre by leaving its most frightening terrors to its audience’s imagination. Simone Simon stars as a Serbian émigré in Manhattan who believes that, because of an ancient curse, any physical intimacy with the man she loves (Kent Smith) will turn her into a feline predator. Lewton, a consummate producer-auteur who oversaw every aspect of his projects, found an ideal director in Jacques Tourneur, a chiaroscuro stylist adept at keeping viewers off-kilter with startling compositions and psychological innuendo. Together, they eschewed the canned effects of earlier monster movies in favor of shocking with subtle shadows and creative audio cues. One of the studio’s most successful movies of the 1940s, CAT PEOPLE raised the creature feature to new heights of sophistication and mystery.<LF>","Jacques Tourneur","Criterion","1:12:54","Simone Simon; Kent Smith"

This accident triggers a series of self-reckonings, as well as a strange romance that proves impossible to shake.

Most important of all is the motorcycle itself, a gift from Daniel that seems to give her more pleasure than any man could deliver.

Led by father John (Nigel Davenport) and mother Ann (director Cornel Wilde’s spouse and frequent collaborator Jean Wallace), the Custance clan sets out on a quest for safety in a savage world that may just end up turning them into the very thing they are fleeing. Actor turned independent filmmaker Cornel Wilde directed eight unique films over the span of two decades, but nothing prepared the audiences of 1970 for the sights that awaited them in NO BLADE OF GRASS. Raw, uncompromising, and violent, the film went largely unseen, but can now at last be appreciated in all its grim, daring, gory glory.","Cornel Wilde","Criterion:’70s Sci-fi","1:37:26","Nigel Davenport; Jean Wallace; John Hamill"

With its tension and gallows humor, it’s pure Hitchcock, and it set the tone for such films as THE 39 STEPS and THE LADY VANISHES.<LF>","Alfred Hitchcock","Criterion:British Hitchcock","1:16:14",""

From cinema’s earliest days, filmmakers have shot close to home—capturing their babies at the dining table or their partners in the garden—out of economic necessity, the desire to make something more immediately personal, or simply because their outsider visions were too weird to be realized anywhere else. This series offers a diverse array of examples of this endlessly fascinating subgenre, exploring how shooting at home can affect everything from performance to composition to mood, creating new cinematic spaces where personal truths and imaginative fictions mingle in an often uneasy coexistence. Seen together, they offer a very different notion of what constitutes a “home movie.”<LF>","","Criterion:Close to Home","1:49",""

Though best known for samurai epics like SEVEN SAMURAI and YOJIMBO, his intimate, contemporary-set dramas, such as IKIRU and HIGH AND LOW, are just as searing. The first serious phase of the director’s career came during the postwar era with DRUNKEN ANGEL and STRAY DOG, striking noirs that marked the beginning of his long-running collaboration with explosive leading man Toshiro Mifune. In the early 1950s, Kurosawa achieved worldwide fame with RASHOMON, a landmark in nonlinear storytelling that ignited international interest in Japanese cinema. In the years that followed, the auteur carried on a fruitful dialogue with the West, drawing on everything from Shakespeare to Dashiell Hammett and perfecting cinematic techniques that would prove influential to such disparate filmmakers as George Lucas and Sam Peckinpah.

Cobb) and Johnny’s right-hand man, Terry’s brother, Charley (Rod Steiger), as the authorities close in on them.

Directed by Elia Kazan from a screenplay by Budd Schulberg, this incisive satire features an extraordinary debut screen performance by Griffith, who brandishes his charm in an uncharacteristically sinister role.

Sent to work as a parlormaid at a stuffy country manor, she proceeds to turn the household upside down—with plenty of help from Adam Belinski (Charles Boyer), an eccentric Continental exile who has fled the Nazis but is still worried about where his next meal is coming from.

Fengjie’s old town has been torn down and submerged forever, but its new neighborhood hasn’t been finished yet.

Though a giant in her time—she ran her own studio, was the first woman director accepted into the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, and at one point was the highest-paid director in Hollywood—her radically progressive body of work was obscured by the male-dominated consolidation of the studio system, making it now ripe for rediscovery.<LF>","","Criterion:Directed by Lois Weber","1:05",""

The pair take it upon themselves to transform her into a lady in hopes of marrying her off to a rich nobleman and splitting the dowry between them.

Assuming the dead woman’s identity, Helen embarks on a dangerous deception that spirals into blackmail and murder.

"Directed by Nikos Papatakis Teaser","0","Startling, subversive, and explosively controversial, the films of Ethiopian-born Greek iconoclast Nikos Papatakis have long been frustratingly hard to see, but they constitute one of the most radical and neglected bodies of work in all of European cinema. A man of the world who rubbed shoulders with Jean Genet and John Cassavetes (he produced the former’s UN CHANT D’AMOUR and the latter’s SHADOWS), Papatakis began his directing career with the incendiary call to class warfare LES ABYSSES, which nearly provoked a riot when it premiered at Cannes in 1963. The scandal was merely a warm-up for a career that courted controversy at every turn and which includes the deliriously surreal romantic tragedy THE SHEPHERDS OF CALAMITY and the shocking Algerian War parable GLORIA MUNDI, a film so inflammatory it could not be shown in Paris for three decades. With their expressionistically heightened style and transgressive themes, Papatakis’s films have served as a major inspiration for the so-called “Weird Wave” of contemporary Greek filmmakers like Yorgos Lanthimos and Athina Rachel Tsangari, who carry on the cinematic rebellion that he launched.<LF>","","Criterion:Directed by Nikos Papatakis","1:14",""

One of the first Hollywood filmmakers to write and direct his own scripts (a deal he negotiated by selling his Oscar-winning screenplay for THE GREAT MCGINTY to Paramount for just $10), Sturges took screwball comedy to new heights of sublime absurdity with his elegantly cockeyed dialogue, free-form approach to narrative, and subversive skewering of conventional morality. These immortal comedy classics—including the Barbara Stanwyck sizzler THE LADY EVE, the everyman ode SULLIVAN’S TRAVELS, and the Production Code–defying jaw-dropper THE MIRACLE OF MORGAN’S CREEK—were the result of a brief but dazzling run of creativity that remains virtually unmatched in Hollywood history.<LF>","","Criterion:Directed by Preston Sturges","1:43",""

When Jimmy’s mischievous coworkers trick him into thinking he’s won, the young man’s newfound “success” goes to his head with madcap consequences.

McGinty’s facility for vice allows him to rise easily through the ranks of the city’s corrupt political machine—but will a rare act of honesty be his undoing?

But when the con artist falls for her mark, her grift becomes a game of hearts—and she is determined to win it all. One in a string of matchless comedic marvels that Sturges wrote and directed as part of a dazzling 1940s run, this gender-flipped battle-of-wits farce is perhaps his most emotionally satisfying work, tempering its sparkling humor with a streak of tender poignancy supplied by the sensational Stanwyck at her peak.<LF>","Preston Sturges","Criterion:Directed by Preston Sturges","1:34:30","Barbara Stanwyck; Henry Fonda; Charles Coburn"

In 1932, she is the daughter of a bourgeois family drawn into the workers’ uprising against the dictatorship of Gerardo Machado. And in the postrevolutionary 1960s, she is a newlywed farm girl fighting against patriarchal oppression. A formally dazzling landmark of postcolonial cinema, LUCÍA is both a senses-stunning visual experience and a fiercely feminist portrait of a society journeying toward liberation.<LF>","Humberto Solás","Criterion:Martin Scorsese’s World Cinema Project","2:41:28","Raquel Revuelta; Eslinda Núñez; Adela Legrá"
"Memories of Underdevelopment (1968)","1968","This film by Tomás Gutiérrez Alea is the most renowned work in the history of Cuban cinema. After his wife and family flee in the wake of the Bay of Pigs invasion, the bourgeois intellectual Sergio (Sergio Corrieri) passes his days wandering Havana in idle reflection, his amorous entanglements and political ambivalence gradually giving way to a mounting sense of alienation. With this adaptation of an innovative novel by Edmundo Desnoes, Gutiérrez Alea developed a cinematic style as radical as the times he was chronicling, creating a collage of vivid impressions through the use of experimental editing techniques, archival material, and spontaneously shot street scenes. Intimate and densely layered, MEMORIES OF UNDERDEVELOPMENT provides an indictment of its protagonist’s disengagement and an extraordinary glimpse of life in postrevolutionary Cuba.<LF><LF>Restored by the Cineteca di Bologna at L’Immagine Ritrovata laboratory in association with Instituto Cubano del Arte e Industria Cinematográficos (ICAIC).

"Pixote (1981)","1981","With its bracing blend of unflinching realism and aching humanity, Héctor Babenco’s electrifying look at lost youth fighting to survive on the bottom rung of Brazilian society helped put the country’s cinema on the international map. Shot with documentary-like immediacy on the streets of São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, PIXOTE follows the eponymous preteen runaway (the heartbreaking Fernando Ramos da Silva, whose own too-short life tragically mirrored that of his character) as he escapes a nightmarish juvenile detention center only to descend into a life of increasingly violent crime alongside a makeshift family of fellow outcasts. Balancing its shocking brutality with moments of tenderness, this stunning journey through Brazil’s underworld is an unforgettable cry from the lower depths that has influenced multiple generations of filmmakers, including Spike Lee, Harmony Korine, and the Safdie brothers.","Héctor Babenco","Criterion:Martin Scorsese’s World Cinema Project","2:07:26","Fernando Ramos da Silva; Jorge Julião; Gilberto Moura"

"Neonoir Teaser","0","While film noir had its heyday in the disillusioned postwar era of the 1940s and ’50s, its seductively moody style and dark, cynical edge have continued to inspire more recent filmmakers—freed from the constraints of the Production Code—to put their own, often subversive stamps on the genre. Featuring unforgettable femmes fatales (Kathleen Turner in the DOUBLE INDEMNITY–inspired BODY HEAT, Linda Fiorentino’s ice-cold bad girl in THE LAST SEDUCTION) and world-weary private eyes (Jack Nicholson in CHINATOWN; Elliott Gould and Robert Mitchum offering their respective takes on Raymond Chandler’s legendary detective Philip Marlowe in THE LONG GOODBYE and FAREWELL, MY LOVELY), this selection of some of the finest neonoirs spotlights the myriad ways in which the hard-boiled vocabulary of noir has endured and evolved over the decades. From the blaxploitation boom (ACROSS 110TH STREET) to Hollywood’s post-Watergate cynicism (NIGHT MOVES, CUTTER’S WAY) to the New Queer Cinema (SWOON) and beyond, these films prove that noir is more than just a single era or movement—it’s a state of mind.<LF>","","Criterion:Neonoir","1:34",""

Unlike the “black cast” films produced within the Hollywood studio system, these films not only starred African Americans but were funded, written, produced, edited, distributed, and often exhibited by people of color. Entrepreneurial filmmakers built an industry apart from the Hollywood establishment, cultivating visual and narrative styles that were uniquely their own. Among the trailblazing artists whose work is featured here are Oscar Micheaux, the first major African American feature filmmaker, whose body of work includes BODY AND SOUL, starring Paul Robeson in his film debut, and WITHIN OUR GATES; Spencer Williams, whose masterpiece THE BLOOD OF JESUS is among the most celebrated race films of the era; Zora Neale Hurston, the renowned writer who was also a pioneering ethnographic filmmaker; and James and Eloyce Gist, DIY evangelist filmmakers whose fascinating morality tales were exhibited in black churches. This landmark collection, curated by scholars Charles Musser and Jacqueline Najuma Stewart for Kino Lorber, collects an astonishing range of features, shorts, and fragments.

The first film to accomplish the very rare feat of sweeping all five major Oscar categories (best picture, best actor, best actress, best director, and best screenplay), IT HAPPENED ONE NIGHT is among the most gracefully constructed and edited films of the early sound era, packed with clever situations and gags that have entered the Hollywood comedy pantheon and featuring two actors at the top of their game, sparking with a chemistry that has never been bettered.<LF>","Frank Capra","Criterion:Read All About It!","1:45:22","Clark Gable; Claudette Colbert; Walter Connolly"

When adapting Ben Hecht and Charles MacArthur’s smash hit play “The Front Page,” director Howard Hawks had the inspired idea of turning star reporter Hildy Johnson into a woman, and the result is an immortal mix of hard-boiled newsroom setting with ebullient remarriage comedy.<LF>","Howard Hawks","Criterion:Read All About It!","1:31:44","Cary Grant; Rosalind Russell; Ralph Bellamy"

When John Doe’s threat captures the public imagination, Ann and her editor seek to boost her career and the paper’s circulation by hiring broken-down ex-ballplayer John Willoughby (Gary Cooper) to give him a face and a voice.

This tale of two newspaper reporters who wed and then discover that their careers aren’t so compatible forges a fresh and realistic vision of what marriage can be. The freewheeling but pinpoint-sharp screenplay by Ring Lardner Jr. and Michael Kanin won an Academy Award, and Hepburn received a nomination for her performance.

In definitive classics of the form like HANDS ACROSS THE TABLE, TWENTIETH CENTURY, MY MAN GODFREY, and NOTHING SACRED, Lombard lit up the screen with her vivacious energy and brilliant comic timing (it’s no surprise that Lombard, who was married first to William Powell, then Clark Gable, was an inveterate prankster offscreen, with a famously foul mouth). Though her tragic death in a plane crash at age thirty-three—just after the completion of her final film, Ernst Lubitsch’s audacious anti-Nazi satire TO BE OR NOT TO BE—robbed Hollywood of one of its brightest stars, Lombard endures thanks to her rare combination of chic elegance and infectious irreverence.<LF>","","Criterion:Starring Carole Lombard","1:15",""

Her attempts to both woo Godfrey and indoctrinate him in the household’s dysfunction make for a string of madcap high jinks that has never been bested.

Jim Jarmusch assembled an extraordinary international cast of actors (including Gena Rowlands, Winona Ryder, Armin Mueller-Stahl, Béatrice Dalle, and Roberto Benigni) for this quintet of transitory tales of urban displacement and existential angst, all staged as encounters between cabbies and their fares. Spanning time zones, continents, and languages, NIGHT ON EARTH winds its course through scenes of uproarious comedy, nocturnal poetry, and somber fatalism, set to a moody soundtrack by Tom Waits. Jarmusch’s lovingly askew view of humanity from the passenger seat makes for one of his most charming and beloved films, a freewheeling showcase for the cosmopolitan range of his imagination.<LF>","Jim Jarmusch","Criterion:Starring Gena Rowlands","2:08:31","Gena Rowlands; Winona Ryder; Rosie Perez"

Whenever Madame is away, the sisters obsessively act out a complex role-playing psychodrama of domination and control that feeds their powerful lust for revenge upon their haughty, disdainful mistress. Director Christopher Miles and cinematographer Douglas Slocombe focus Genet’s heady theatricality into a riveting and dynamic cinematic experience. In a world where the lines between mistress and servant, confession and accusation, degradation and redemption, and murder and suicide become as fragile as French lace, the fatal truth remains that, “naturally, maids are guilty when madams are innocent.”<LF>","Christopher Miles","Criterion:Starring Glenda Jackson","1:33:59","Glenda Jackson; Susannah York; Vivien Merchant"

Inspired by his mentor Paul Robeson, Belafonte used his celebrity to take on roles that challenged racial prejudices and taboos in films like the hard-hitting noir ODDS AGAINST TOMORROW and the apocalyptic science-fiction drama THE WORLD, THE FLESH AND THE DEVIL, both of which he coproduced. Projecting an easygoing charisma and passionate intensity in front of the camera and making key contributions behind it (the hip-hop drama BEAT STREET, which he produced and composed the music for but did not appear in, is also included here), Belafonte was instrumental in transforming the depiction of Black Americans on-screen and remains a fiercely outspoken advocate for progressive political and social change.<LF>","","Criterion:Starring Harry Belafonte","1:02",""

"Joan Crawford Teaser","0","Like the ambitious, upwardly mobile working women she became famous for portraying, Joan Crawford forged one of the longest-lasting and brightest-burning careers of Hollywood’s golden age through her fierce determination, dedication to her craft, and remarkable ability to continually reinvent herself. Rising through the ranks of MGM, she went from Jazz Age flapper ingenue (OUR DANCING DAUGHTERS) to emblem of Depression-era tenacity (DANCING LADY, SADIE MCKEE) to A-list diva (THE WOMEN) to, by the early 1940s, so-called “box-office poison.” The first of multiple career comebacks ensued with her ferocious, Academy Award–winning turn in the stone-cold noir classic MILDRED PIERCE, leading to a second life as a melodrama queen in films like HUMORESQUE, POSSESSED, and AUTUMN LEAVES. And when it once again seemed like her career might fade away, the indomitable Crawford transformed herself into a 1960s horror grande dame in the gothic camp classic WHAT EVER HAPPENED TO BABY JANE?

"Our Dancing Daughters (1928)","1928","In this classic of Jazz Age vivacity, Joan Crawford stripped to her teddy and tore into a Charleston powered by a zillion watts of sexual energy—and shocked the corsets and cravats off parents who’d heard disturbing rumblings of what their children were up to. But the younger generation couldn’t get enough: they’d found their icon of flaming youth. Crawford became a star in this silent milestone about a good girl who hides her heart behind a party-girl mask and loses the man she loves to a gold digger. The film’s portrait of a modern woman who matches men drink for drink and vice for vice inspired F. Scott Fitzgerald to dub Crawford “doubtless the best example of the flapper . . .

Three screen icons give the backstage musical a jolt of superstar electricity in a song-, dance- and romance-filled extravaganza featuring support by singer Nelson Eddy, humorist Robert Benchley, and an up-and-coming act soon to be known as the Three Stooges.

"Mildred Pierce (1945)","1945","Melodrama casts noirish shadows in this portrait of maternal sacrifice from Hollywood master Michael Curtiz. Its iconic performance by Joan Crawford as Mildred, a single mother hell-bent on freeing her children from the stigma of economic hardship, solidified Crawford’s career comeback and gave the actor her only Oscar. But as Mildred pulls herself up by the bootstraps, first as an unflappable waitress and eventually as the well-heeled owner of a successful restaurant chain, the ingratitude of her materialistic firstborn (a diabolical Ann Blyth) becomes a venomous serpent’s tooth, setting in motion an endless cycle of desperate overtures and heartless recriminations. Recasting James M.

In a world ravaged by STBO, a sexually transmitted disease only acquired by people having sex without any emotion, a rebellious young man (Denis Lavant) is recruited by a veteran criminal (Michel Piccoli) to steal the antidote.

His drama Code Unknown, the first of his many films made in France, may be his most inspired work. Composed almost entirely of brilliantly shot, single-take vignettes focusing on characters connected to one seemingly minor incident on a Paris street, Haneke's film, with an outstanding international cast headlined by Juliette Binoche, is a revelatory examination of racial inequality and the failure of communication in an increasingly diverse modern landscape.<LF>","Michael Haneke","Criterion:Starring Juliette Binoche","1:57:55","Juliette Binoche"

One day, their idyll is disrupted by a mysterious videotape that appears on their doorstep. It shows them being filmed by a hidden camera from across the street, offering no clues as to who shot it, or why.

Three siblings, played by Juliette Binoche, Charles Berling, and Jérémie Rénier, must decide what to do with the country estate and objects they've inherited from their mother. From this simple story, Assayas creates an exquisitely nuanced drama about the material of globalized modern living.

"Elles (2011)","2011","A provocative and raw exploration of female sexuality, director Malgorzata Szumowska’s ELLES paints an unromantic picture of upper-crust domesticity refracted through the world of sex work. The fearless Juliette Binoche stars as Anne, a well-off Parisian journalist investigating the lives of two student prostitutes (Joanna Kulig and Anaïs Demoustier) for a magazine article. What begins as a routine assignment shaped by preconceived notions quickly turns personal, as Anne is drawn into the lives of these fiercely independent young women and forced to confront her own sexual fears and desires.

Now she is being asked to step into the other role, that of the older Helena. She departs with her assistant to rehearse in Sils Maria; a remote region of the Alps.

"Camille Claudel 1915 (2013)","2013","Juliette Binoche gives a mesmerizing performance as the sculptor Camille Claudel during the time when she was imprisoned in an insane asylum. Camille was also the sister of the Christian mystic poet Paul Claudel, the last of her family to pay her regular visits. Inspired by the correspondence between Paul and Camille, writer-director Bruno Dumont focuses on Camille’s struggle to maintain a sense of normalcy in a crowd of schizophrenics. Struggling from bouts of paranoia (she believes her mentor and lover Rodin is poisoning her), she focuses on her art and her family as pillars of sanity, until those too begin to crumble. Dumont shot the film in a real asylum with a supporting cast of actual patients and their nurses, highlighting the thin line between the insane and those who treat them.","Bruno Dumont","Criterion:Starring Juliette Binoche","1:35:03","Juliette Binoche; Jean-Luc Vincent"

Their leisurely rhythm of sunbathing and seaside constitutionals is soon interrupted by the arrival of two bumbling inspectors investigating a string of tourists gone missing (and serving full-on Keystone Kops). As the macabre mysteries mount and love blossoms between the family’s genderqueer teen and the son of a local fisherman, the slapstick ratchets up to eleven. It’s no wonder that director Bruno Dumont cites Peter Sellers, Monty Python, and Laurel and Hardy as cinematic influences for his delightful foray into winking, absurdist farce.","Bruno Dumont","Criterion:Starring Juliette Binoche","2:02:47","Juliette Binoche; Fabrice Luchini; Valeria Bruni Tedeschi"

Mitchum solidified his tough-guy persona in this archetypal film noir directed with memorable style by Jacques Tourneur.

Chafing against the dullness of the “respectable” orchestras for which he works, Martin rises to popularity with his own group—but soon finds himself torn between an honest torch singer (Doris Day) and a wealthy but manipulative jazz patron (Lauren Bacall, playing one of classic Hollywood’s most overtly queer-coded characters) who leads him down a path of self-destruction.<LF>","Michael Curtiz","Criterion:Starring Kirk Douglas","1:52:25","Kirk Douglas; Lauren Bacall; Doris Day"

"Starring Robert Mitchum Teaser","0","Original Hollywood bad boy Robert Mitchum’s blend of rugged masculinity, antiauthoritarian attitude, and lightly bemused irony made him one of the defining faces of postwar film noir, a genre upon which he left an indelible mark in stone-cold classics like OUT OF THE PAST, CROSSFIRE, and ANGEL FACE. Unnervingly at home in antihero roles, he embodied some of the most frightening villains in all of cinema, including the menacing, knuckle-tattooed preacher in Charles Laughton’s dark fairy tale THE NIGHT OF THE HUNTER and the psychotic ex-con out for revenge in the terrifying home-invasion thriller CAPE FEAR. But out of the noir shadows, Mitchum’s nonchalant air and unforced naturalism lent something special to a wide array of films, including William A. Wellman’s fascinatingly stylized snowbound western TRACK OF THE CAT and Vincente Minnelli’s florid family melodrama HOME FROM THE HILL. Encompassing Mitchum’s autumnal turns in films like the world-weary crime drama THE FRIENDS OF EDDIE COYLE and Jim Jarmusch’s DEAD MAN, this career-spanning tribute to the legend known as “Old Rumple Eyes” is proof positive that he was, quite simply, one of the all-time coolest guys ever to grace the screen.<LF>","","Criterion:Starring Robert Mitchum","0:59",""

Described by director Roger Vadim as “a kind of sexual ‘Alice in Wonderland’ of the future,” BARBARELLA has taken its place as a midnight-movie classic thanks to its trippy art direction and sense of kitschy comic-book fun.<LF><LF>Barbarella is a 1968 science fiction film directed by Roger Vadim, based on the comic series of the same name by Jean-Claude Forest. The film stars Jane Fonda as Barbarella, a space-traveler and representative of the United Earth government sent to find scientist Durand Durand, who has created a weapon that could destroy humanity.<LF><LF>As a director who expressed an interest in comics and science fiction, Vadim was hired to direct Barbarella after producer Dino De Laurentiis purchased the film rights to the comic series. Vadim attempted to cast several actors in the title role (including Virna Lisi, Brigitte Bardot, and Sophia Loren) before choosing his then-wife, Fonda. A friend of Vadim's, Terry Southern, wrote the initial screenplay, which changed considerably during filming and led to seven other writers credited in the final release, including Vadim and Forest. The film began shooting immediately following the completion of another De Laurentiis comic adaptation, Danger: Diabolik, with both films sharing several cast and crew members.<LF><LF>The film was particularly popular in the United Kingdom, where it was the year's second-highest-grossing film. Contemporary film critics praised Barbarella's visuals and cinematography, but found its storyline weak after the first few scenes.

Director Andrew Haigh carries the tradition of British realist cinema to artful new heights in 45 YEARS, weaving the momentous into the mundane as the pair go about their daily lives, while the evocatively flat, wintry Norfolk landscape frames their struggle to maintain an increasingly untenable status quo. Loosely adapting a short story by David Constantine, Haigh shifts the focus from the slightly erratic Geoff to Kate, eliciting a remarkable, nuanced portrayal by Rampling of a woman’s gradual metamorphosis from unflappable wife to woman undone.<LF>","","Criterion:Twenty-First-Century Cinema","0:04",""

Arriving at his cramped office, Butley is informed that his adored Joey is moving in with another man, his estranged wife is remarrying, and his seemingly untalented colleague has been published ahead of him. As embodied by Alan Bates, Butley falls back on the surgically precise wit and savage eloquence that helped put him in his current circumstances. The blitzkrieg of vitriolic commentary with which Butley engages lovers, students, rivals, and allies becomes a glass-bottom boat illuminating the churning depths of his bankrupted soul.
